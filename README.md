This is a procedural artwork released at SynchroNY 2020, placing 1st in the Graphics competition.

This source code release is for archival reasons - as such, aside from removal of compiled and intermediate binaries, this is an unedited snapshot of the source from when the released artwork was built.

This uses [Shader_Minifier](https://github.com/laurentlb/Shader_Minifier) for shader minification and [Crinkler](https://github.com/runestubbe/Crinkler) for executable compression. Binaries are included in the archive as the exact versions that were used for the release.

Some post-mortem thoughts:

* This was my first use of pathtraced direct lighting, using [this article](http://blog.hvidtfeldts.net/index.php/2015/01/path-tracing-3d-fractals/) as a reference.

* SynchroNY takes place on an Amtrak train between NYC and Montreal, and originally I wanted to create something based around the train, hence the folder name `exegfx-amtrak`.
